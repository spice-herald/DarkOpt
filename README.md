## Phonon Detector Design

Copied from Joe Singh's PD2 repo:
	
	A simulation for PD2 to obtain energy and position resolution. 

	Current issues:

	* Total load resistances/temperatures in electronics 
	* Expoential overflow in simulated_noise line 131.
	* Correct placement of squares etc. in formulae in simulated noise? Index manipulations maybe wrong
	also?

which in turn was a python translation and reorganization of much of Matt Pyle's matlab optimization code.
